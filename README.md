# todo-list
 
Built with React, Redux, Bootstrap.

Run with:
1. `npm start`
2. Browse to http://localhost:3000

Currently uses Local Storage to store list items across browser sessions. This can be unreliable when running from localhost.

To deploy:

`npm run deploy`

If getting "fatal: A branch named 'gh-pages' already exists" error, delete node_modules\gh-pages\.cache
